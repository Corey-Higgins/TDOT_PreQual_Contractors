The goal of the script is to extract the contractor data from the publicly provided pdf the user can download at the following site:
https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/construction/prequal.pdf

1.) Download the latest file to directory
2.) Script Workflow
2A) user selects pdf from saved directory via file selection dialog
2B) the script extracts the various fields associated with each contractor in the pdf and enters the details into the spreadsheet
The pdf data isn't well structured in my opinion to make this process easy. I want the excel file to be easily filterable and sortable.
